"""
This example demonstrates how to use Goose to plan a meal.

Meal planning is a good use case because it demonstrates the need for tasks to depend on the outputs of other tasks.
You have your initial flow input, which is your overall health goals, and that's the starting point for breakfast.
But then lunch is a function of both your goals and your breakfast.
And then dinner is a function of your goals, your breakfast, and your lunch.
